# Phase 4 Project

## Project Basis
For my fourth Flatiron School Project, I've built a pet feeding schedule app using SQLite, Ruby, Ruby On Rails, and React. In the application, you log in to an account that is connected to a family account to add pets to your family. The pets can then have a schedule created for them to keep track of who feeds them each day in the morning or night. 

## Project Use
The main idea behind this project is to create a feeding schedule for your pets. The log in page requests you to log in or sign up. If you sign up you must select if you are joining an existing family or creating a new family. If you create a new family, you must create a family name and password. If joining an existing family, you must enter your family name and password. After you must create a username and password for your personal use. After logging in, you will see your family's pets. Using the navbar you can see your account info, add another pet, or log out. By clicking on a pet's name you can see the pet's schedule and if there is a user assigned for a day and time or if there is no user assigned. By clicking the 'Add to Schedule', you can add to that pet's schedule.
